##Hand-written Number Classification
This project focuses on implementing a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using a Neural Network. The system is capable of detecting scanned images of handwritten digits. It utilizes the popular MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
It's features are:

1)Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) from scanned images.
2)Utilizes a Neural Network for classification.
3)Trained on the MNIST dataset, a benchmark for handwritten digit recognition.

This is how the model works:
Data Preparation: The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing. It consists of labeled images of handwritten digits.

Neural Network Architecture:

Input Layer: Flatten the 28x28 pixel images into a 784-dimensional vector.
Hidden Layers: Customize the architecture based on experimentation.
Output Layer: 10 nodes for classifying digits (0-9).
Training:

The Neural Network learns to recognize patterns in the training data through backpropagation and gradient descent.
Testing and Validation:

The trained model is evaluated on a separate set of images (not seen during training) to assess its accuracy and performance.


I would like to thank Bharat Intern for providing me with the opportunity to learn more about this topic.
